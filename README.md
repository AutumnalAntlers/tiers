### Offline Tierlist Maker

This is a simple webpage that allows creating custom "[Tierlists](https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/tier-lists)".

I was looking for a decent app that would allow me to do that offline without uploading my images to a server or requiring an account, but I couldn't find any, so I made one myself.

It's still quite rough and is missing some key features (like saving/exporting the tierlist), but that'll arrive sooner or later.

Meanwhile you can play with the latest version at [silverweed.github.io/tiers](https://silverweed.github.io/tiers).
